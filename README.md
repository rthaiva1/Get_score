This IOS application is built on spritkit, this is a space game where we have a player, villian
The game is about player trying to destroy the enemies

Description:-
So the one in yellow at bottom is our player and villian's will be coming continously to destroy our player

Player special abilities:-
1.Bullets that can destroy the enemies

3.Time reverse :-  Reverse the time and destroy the enemies that went always
