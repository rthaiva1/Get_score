# Get_Score
# Astroid Game
This IOS application is built on spritkit, this is a space game where we have a player, villian
The game is about player trying to destroy the enemies 

Description:-
The menu gives an option to start a new game and display the highscores, if you click on high scores you will get list scores updated on my sql server.

So the one in yellow at bottom is our player and villian's will be coming continously to destroy our player

Player special abilities:-
1.Bullets that can destroy the enemies
2.Freeze:- Stop the enemies from speeding by continously touching the freeze button
3.Time reverse :-  Reverse the time and destroy the enemies that went always
4.Hammer :- Call the Lord of Thunder for support and weaken the enemies
5.Kill :- Burn all the enemies to death in a instant

Idea:- I always played space game but I wished the player has some cool features rather than only bullets

Future update: Add feature like boss and difficulty level
